  This issue has not received any updates in quite some time. It's not clear whether it's still relevant, and should be
  kept.

  If there is no more activity in the next 14 days on this ticket, I will close it. It can always be reopened later, but
  for now in the interests of keeping the project as clear and simple as possible it will be closed.

  If you'd like to keep it open simply comment:

    "This needs to remain open"

  And I will leave it alone for the next 90 days or so.

  Alternatively, if you are already sure that this is no longer relevant you can also close it directly.
