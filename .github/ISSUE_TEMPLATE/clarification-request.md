<!--

  If you'd like to:

  - Know something you think we can tell you
  - Have additional documentation for something
  - Clarify what's in the documentation

  This issue is for you.

  The result of these issues should be more documentation. So, if this issue has been raised before (or even if it
  has not) there is likely to be something that answers your question.

  Have a look for that before you raise his issue. If you don't find it, simply

  Try and have a look in the project documentation before requesting clarification. These requests ultimately result
  in additional documentation, so if the question has been asked before it's probably in there somewhere.
