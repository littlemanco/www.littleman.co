Recently I had to set up mutual TLS authentication between a MySQL server and a replica which gave me the first 
chance to really dive into setting up and running a CA, and implementing mutual authentication. It was a cool learning 
experience, and I’d like to recap and expand on some of the learning I had. 

NOTE: This isn't a 100% accurate reflection of the specification. Rather, it's simplified in some places to build some
      mental model that helps us understand how TLS works. Where terms are mentioned there are links that can be used
      to find a more exact meanining.

== The problem of data safety

Computers communicate by sending messages to one another. In this case computer "Alice" would like to send a message
that instructs the computer "Bob" how to display a website. It's easy to think that Alice talks directly to Bob:

However, generally speaking Alice and Bob do not talk this way. Rather their conversation is mediated by other
computers. These computers are usually termed "routers" or "firewalls" or any other appliance like name but they are
nonetheless just another type of computer. These intermediary computers mediate things like allowing Alice, Bob and
Paul to use the same phone line or connecting Alice and Bob with their colleagues in the next city. Computers generally
look more like:

image:/images/the-magic-of-tls-and-x509-explained/alice-sends-bob-the-website-via-intermediaries.png[Alice talking to Bob via intermediaries]

This presents Alice and Bob with several problems:

1. Alice and Bob cannot be sure that the intermediary computers have not recorded their discussions.
2. When Alice sends a message to Bob and receives a reply, she cannot be sure that Bob is the one who sent the reply --
   not one of the intermediary computers.
3. Alice can't be sure that what Bob says has not been modified en route.

Luckily, there is a mechanism to solve this exact problem.

== Transport Layer Security

Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) have existed since since 
1996^cite:[rfc.6101]^ to solve this problem. As mentioned there are two types of problem that need to be solved:

=== Ensuring data is not readable by intermediaries

In order to ensure that data is not read by the computers that sit between a network connection the data is encrypted.
Encryption is defined as ^cite:[wikipedia.encryption]^:

[quote,Wikipedia]
The process of encoding a message such that only those who should be able to read and understand it can read and 
understand it.

In order to discuss things privately Alice needs to encode the message in some way that Bob can decode and understand
it. Unfortunately this is a chicken and egg problem:

1. Alice needs to tell Bob how she will encode the data, but
2. Anything Alice says will be picked up by the intermediaries, so
3. The intermediaries can also decode the data!

The solution lies in a process called "public key" or "asymmetric" cryptography.

Without going too deep into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Encryption[how this works] we need to know
that Bob already has an the key for an encoding that will allow him to decode secret messages from Alice. Bobs encoding
is split into two pieces:

* A “public” key, which contains the reference to encode the data, and
* A “private” key, which contains the reference to decode the data

This means Bob can share the "public" half of his key to any who would ask for it. Any information that is encoded with
his public key can only be decrypted with his private key; the key that only Bob has. This allows anyone who knows
Bob to send Bob secret information!

TIP: This pattern is widely employed in a variety of technical systems. Popular implementations include the Pretty
     Good Privacy (PGP) and Secure Shell (SSH) protocols.

So, to start a secret conversation Alice needs to ask for Bob's Public key:

image:/images/the-magic-of-tls-and-x509-explained/alice-asks-bob-for-public-key.png[Alice asks Bob for his public key]

This allows Alice to send secret messages to Bob. However, there is a weakness: Bob cannot send secret messages back
to Alice! In order to send a secret message back to Alice, Bob needs a key that only Alice will understand.

Alice knows that she can send information to Bob that only Bob can read. She can take advantage of this to send Bob some
secret information that describes how both she and Bob can encode secret information back and fourth to each other.

This 1 way secrecy allows the creation of a "symmetric" key. As opposed to our asymmetric key from earlier, both Alice
and Bob can encode information against the same key. While this key was shared between Alice and Bob, they are the only
ones that should know it as it was passed encoded by alice and sent to Bob via asymmetric encryption.

This creates the two way, secret connection:

image:/images/the-magic-of-tls-and-x509-explained/alice-and-bob-talk-secretly.png[Alice and Bob talk secretly]

At the end of this process Alice and Bob can both send secret information to each other all day long without worrying
about whether anyone is recording their connection. It doesn't matter -- only Alice and Bob are able to understand the
conversation but any intermediary can hear only gibberish.

However, there is still a flaw: How does Alice know Bob is Bob?

=== Ensuring Bob is Bob

In the examples described, we know that Alice is talked to Bob through a network of computers. However, what happens
if one of those computers suddenly starts pretending to be Bob?

image:/images/the-magic-of-tls-and-x509-explained/alice-thinks-she-is-talking-to-bob.png[Alice thinks she is talking to Bob]

Without knowing Bob beforehand, it’s impossible for Alice to know “Bob” is “Bob”. Alice will simply start an encrypted 
connection with whomever pretends to be Bob. Indeed, although it’s not shown here, the intermediary can pretend to be
Bob to Alice, and Alice to Bob! This is termed a “Man in the middle attack”.

However, there is a part of the TLS standard that is also designed to solve this problem. Specifically, when Alice first
indicates to Bob that she’d like to start talking over an encoded connection she not only asks for his public key
but also for him to provide a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509[certificate] (in the form of X.509) proving who he is.
She then asks a set of trusted advisers called “certificate authorities” whether Bob seems legit, and decides whether to
proceed based on what those authorities have to say.

image:/images/the-magic-of-tls-and-x509-explained/alice-verifies-bob-is-bob.png[Alice verifies Bob is Bob]

Where a certificate is not vouched for by an authority, Alice will simply reject the connection.

image:/images/the-magic-of-tls-and-x509-explained/alice-verifies-bob-is-not-bob.png[Alice verifies Bob is not Bob]

=== Ensuring Alice is Alice

For Alice, the connection is now happy and fairly secure. She knows the Bob she’s talking to is the real Bob, and that
only she and Bob can see the messages being exchanged. However, Bob has no such assurance that Alice is Alice.

There are two sides to each connection:

* The “Client”. In this case, that’s Alice — she sends the first message.
* The “Server”. In this case, that’s Bob — he responds to (or “serves”) the messages.

Verifying Bob is Bob is an extremely common operation. Indeed, while viewing this post it’s extremely likely your 
browser verified that the blog website you see before you is the blog website it claims to be. Verifying Alice is 
actually Alice is a much less common operation, but is generally called 
“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication[Mutual TLS authentication]” as both Alice and Bob are verified.

Consider the scenario in which Bob is expecting some sensitive, perhaps medical or similar data from Alice. Bob will 
then process that data and then make a diagnosis about Alice condition. In this case, Bob definitely wants to be sure
that Alice is the real Alice, and is not making up fake diagnostic data!

Luckily, the aforementioned TLS standard can be easily extended to include the same verification process for Alice as 
for Bob:

image:/images/the-magic-of-tls-and-x509-explained/bob-verifies-alice-is-alice.png[Bob verifies Alice is Alice]

Now that both Alice and Bob both have strong guarantees that they are who they say they are (vouched for by their 
certificate authorities) and the connection is encrypted this connection can be said to be very secure.

== In Conclusion

Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the X.509 certificate can seem when first encountered like essentially magical things
that somehow provide security but it’s not clear exactly how or why. After implementing them a couple of times and
going through the required debugging to get everything talking correctly to each other it becomes a simpler task. 
Hopefully this post has gone some way to making that debugging process eventually easier.
