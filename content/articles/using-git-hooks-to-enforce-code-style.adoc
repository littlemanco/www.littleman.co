I started as a professional developer a couple of years after playing with development for a couple of years as a 
hobbyist, or to solve specific business problems that I was having. Then, through some … ahh, unexpected life events, 
I found myself working as a developer professionally.

I am forever indebted to my former colleagues at Fontis. From no qualifications and not really knowing what a HTTP 
status code is, they taught me the craft of software development. However, for a little while there it was rough going.
Years of working solo or in small, relaxed teams had left my code style looking like the code had gone through a blender
and been painted on my screen by a toddler on with cocaine.

However, in short order I worked out how to successfully fake being tidy, which I still use to this day.

== Linting

Luckily, it looks like I am not the only one to struggle getting the code-style correct. There is an entire class of 
tools that help with this problem! These are called “linting” tools:

> A linter or lint refers to tools that analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and 
> suspicious constructs. The term is originated from a Unix utility that examined C language source code.
> — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)

These tools were my savour. Gone was all ambiguity as to which brace should go where, or what style of comments should 
be used. In particular, I can recommend the following tools:

1. PHP Code Sniffer
2. ESLint
3. stylelint
4. Shellcheck
5. Yamllint
6. Xmllint

As well, I am sure there are many more. I recommend as you’re choosing your tools, you pick ones that integrate well 
with your IDE. However, this is not enough to fake it all the way; I am so lazy I forget to use them!

== Git Hooks
I use (and highly recommend) using the Git version control tool, and almost entirely from the CLI. It provides a series 
of hooks, or simple scripts that are executed at certain stages during the version control lifecycle. From the man page:

> Hooks are programs you can place in a hooks directory to trigger actions at certain points in git’s execution. Hooks 
> that don’t have the executable bit set are ignored. By default the hooks directory is $GIT_DIR/hooks, but that can be
> changed via the core.hooksPath configuration variable (see git-config(1)).
> — man “githooks”

They’re pretty cool, and I encourage you to read further into them. However, for the purpose of this blog, the one 
we’re most interested in is:

> pre-commit
> This hook is invoked by git commit, and can be bypassed with the — no-verify option. It takes no parameters, and is 
> invoked before obtaining the proposed commit log message and making a commit. Exiting with a non-zero status from this
> script causes the git commit command to abort before creating a commit.

Excellent! So, we can use this git hook to run our lints. But, what’s particularly exciting is that git will abort the 
commit if the lints fail. I can’t commit bad code! This can look practically something like this:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# Written in bash, as it's such a good language for dirty hax like this
# Some boilerplate
EXIT_CODE_ABORT=1
LINT_FAILURE=0

# Get the list of files that this commit touches
FILES=$(git diff --name-only --staged)

for FILE in ${FILES}; do
    # It's no good linting files that have been deleted! Check if
    # the file exists
    stat "${FILE}" 2>&1 > /dev/null
    
    # If the file does not exist, then skip it. It's been deleted
    if [[ $? != 0 ]]; then
        echo "Cant' stat file. Skipping!"
    else
        # Run the actual linter. In this case it's PHPCS
        phpcs "${FILE}"
        # Capture the failure. We don't actually want to exit here,
        # As that will not run any of the subsequent files. It's
        # better to run all the lints at once, and notify if any
        # of them failed.
        if [[ $? != 0 ]]; then
           LINT_FAILURE=1
        fi
    fi
done
# If any of the files failed linting, then terminate. We do not
# want to commit bad files! 
if [[ ${LINT_FAILURE} == 1 ]]; then
  exit ${EXIT_CODE_ABORT}
fi
----

Put this content in the `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file and chmod +x it and you’ve got yourself a safety between you and 
looking stupid. Hooray!

== Theory vs reality

Unfortunately, there are some cases in which it’s not reasonable to fix the code style of another file. Whether it’s 
terrible, terrible upstream code that you’re patching just to fix or whether you need to get things done in an 
emergency, there are times when you want to be able to commit terrible code.

However, what can happen when you can commit terrible code is that you often commit terrible code. Enter: the skip 
penalty!

At the beginning of my pre-commit hooks is the following:

[source,bash]
----
if [[ -n ${SKIP_LINTS} ]]; then
echo -e '\e[0;31m' # Red
cat <<"EOF"
                            ,-.
       ___,---.__          /'|`\          __,---,___
    ,-'    \`    `-.____,-'  |  `-.____,-'    //    `-.
  ,'        |           ~'\     /`~           |        `.
 /      ___//              `. ,'          ,  , \___      \
|    ,-'   `-.__   _         |        ,    __,-'   `-.    |
|   /          /\_  `   .    |    ,      _/\          \   |
\  |           \ \`-.___ \   |   / ___,-'/ /           |  /
 \  \           | `._   `\\  |  //'   _,' |           /  /
  `-.\         /'  _ `---'' , . ``---' _  `\         /,-'
     ``       /     \    ,='/ \`=.    /     \       ''
             |__   /|\_,--.,-.--,--._/|\   __|
             /  `./  \\`\ |  |  | /,//' \,'  \
            /   /     ||--+--|--+-/-|     \   \     YOU SKIPPED LINTS. I SAW THAT.
           |   |     /'\_\_\ | /_/_/`\     |   |    GONNA GO EAT A PUPPY.
            \   \__, \_     `~'     _/ .__/   /
             `-._,-'   `-._______,-'   `-._,-'
EOF
echo -e "\e[0m" # Off
    sleep 20
    exit 0
fi
----

Pretty quickly, you can see the idea ;) This allows me to skip the lints with the following bash invocation:

[source,bash]
----
SKIP_LINTS=1 git commit -m "haha this is a bad idea"
----

but I have to pay a penalty for doing so. I get presented with:

image:/images/using-git-hooks-to-enforce-code-style/scary-face-rendered-in-terminal.png[]

and must wait 20 seconds. This has been about the right balance; less time and I found I was simply skipping the lints
for … well, not very good reasons. More time and it becomes a pain.

== Lint all the things

Unfortunately not all linters implement the same format, conventions or even exit codes. It can get super messy managing
the various output formats etc. However, there is a solution here!

In a previous job, we used the project management tool Phabricator. It is a superb tool, and I encourage you to look 
into it if you are looking for free alternatives to BitBucket or Github.

However, relevant to this blog is it’s CLI tool, arcanist. This tool is used for creating “diffs” (basically pull 
requests) from the CLI, among other things. One of the cooler things it does is runs lints over the code locally prior 
to creating the diff. This function can be invoked with arc lint.

It provides a series of primitives for collecting the output of many linters! Additionally, it is extensible, and can be
integrated with linters that it does not support as first class citizens easily. It uses configuration called .arclint;
an example is blow:

[source,json]
----
{
  "linters": {
    "php": {
      "type": "php",
      "include": "(\\.(php|phtml)$)"
    },
    "phpcs": {
      "type": "phpcs",
      "bin": "vendor/bin/phpcs",
      "include": "(\\.(php|phtml)$)",
      "phpcs.standard": "PSR2"
    }
  }
}
----

Given the above configuration, instead of our earlier `phpcs ${FILE}`, we can instead run `arc lint ${FILE}` and it will
 run all appropriate lints over that file. Cool huh! This solves two problems:

1. We can indicate which files should be run with which lints, and
2. Arcanist will present the output of many linters in a pretty format which is easy to read

Writing the configuration can be annoying, but it’s worth consulting the docs and futzing around for a few hours to get 
it working.

== Lint all the repos

I work across maybe 30 different repos at various points in time in my development year. Setting hooks up for all of 
them is tiresome, so I use a centralised git hooks dir which looks for repository specific configuration (the .arclint 
file i mentioned earlier).

This looks like this:

[source,bash]
----
# ~/.gitconfig
[core]
 hooksPath = /opt/git-hooks
----

This means that, instead of setting up and maintaining many hooks, I can simply create .arclint files in each repo. 
These then go into version control, and I can point colleagues to this awesome habit.

== Final thoughts
So, that’s how I fake it. Practically speaking it makes no difference; indeed, I would say that my code is a little more
consistent than colleagues who do not do this by virtue of simply delegating the analysis to a system that’s way better 
at it than humans ever could be.

You can see my pre-commit hook on GitHub, if you’re looking for inspiration.
