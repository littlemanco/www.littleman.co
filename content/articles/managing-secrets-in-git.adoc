== Initial Caveats

So, I think a centralised model of secret management (such as Hashicorps Vault) is a superior model, as it allows

- Audit Trails
- Easy revocation and rotation of credentials
- A canonical place to view secrets, and manage ACLs
- Ongoing improvements in “security posture” (or, less breaking over time)

However, that requires a certain level of infrastructure (running vault, and having the procedures in place to manage 
service outages and other maintenance). So, a reasonable intermediary as this infrastructure is being set up is below.

== Requirements

In order to store content in version control you will need:

- `git`
- `git-crypt`
- GnuPG
- `envsubst`

== Instructions

First, let’s start by creating an empty `git` repo

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p /tmp/foo
cd /tmp/foo
git init .
----

Next, we need to initialize `git-crypt`. `git-crypt` is the magic behind this type of secret management. It transparently 
encrypts resources in version control based on a `.gitattributes` file. We’ll be using GnuPG as our identity provider; 
git-crypt also supports a shared symmetric key but my recommendation is “use PGP”. It’s handy for a bunch of other 
stuff anyway. If you’re new to PGP, check out the following link to get started:

- https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key/

Once you’ve done that, come back here.

…

Okay, let’s continue! Let’s initialise `git-crypt`

[source,bash]
----
git-crypt init
# Generating key...
----

We also need to add our key the repository so that resources will be encrypted with it. Please note: this key will need
to be trusted!

[source,bash]
----
export YOUR_EMAIL="totallylegit@andrewhowden.com" # Replace with the email for your PGP key
git-crypt add-gpg-user ${YOUR_EMAIL}
# [master (root-commit) ccaef5f] Add 1 git-crypt collaborator
# 2 files changed, 3 insertions(+)
# create mode 100644 .git-crypt/.gitattributes
# create mode 100644 .git-crypt/keys/default/0/THIS_WILL_BE_YOUR_KEY_ID.gpg
----

We can now encrypt things in version control! Let’s create a simple secret as an example. We’ll create a file called 
`.env`. This file can be consumed by several credential managers, such as:

- `envsubst`
- dotenv (ruby)
- dotenv (php)

This file is a simple key → value pairing, fashioned after other environment files (for example `/etc/environment`). 
On my development machine, `/etc/environment` looks like:

[source,bash]
----
COMPOSER_HOME=/opt/composer
----

Let’s create this file

[source,bash]
----
echo 'MYSQL_PASSWORD="this-is-a-totally-secure-mysql-password"' > .env
----

However, the file is not encrypted just yet. `git-crypt` works by using a git-attribute hook to encrypt the files as 
they’re being committed. So, we need to create a `.gitattributes` file.

[source,bash]
----
echo ".env filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt" > .gitattributes
----
You can read more about git attributes here:

- https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes

Now, we can stage those files:

[source,bash]
----
# Note: You'll notice that my staged summary looks a little different than normal. I use a git plugin called "scmpuff"
# to add numbered shortcuts to my git files. It's excellent, and recommend you take a look:
#
# https://github.com/mroth/scmpuff

git add .env .gitattributes
# On branch: master  |  [*] => $e*
#
➤ Changes to be committed
#
#       new file:  [1] .env
#       new file:  [2] .gitattributes
#
----

Once they’re staged, we can verify that file is to be encrypted:

[source,bash]
----
git-crypt status -e
#    encrypted: .env
----

Aaand commit!

[source,bash]
----
# Just ignore the bit about "all keys". It will make sense shortly.
git commit -F - <<EOF
Added encrypted database information to .env

Previously, this repository was initialised with git-crypt, allowing
secret information to be stored securely. This commit adds the
connection information for the production database endpoint to the
repository in the .env file, as well as .gitattributes indicating that
this file should be encrypted.

All keys are allowed access to this file.
EOF
----

That’s it! That file is encrypted, and only you can decrypted it. But don’t trust me, let’s sanity check it:

[source,bash]
----
cat .env
MYSQL_PASSWORD="this-is-a-totally-secure-mysql-password"
# AAH WHAT THIS ISNT ENCRYPTED YOU DECEIVED ME!
----

Don’t panic! `git-crypt` works by encrypting files as they commit. You usually won’t see the encrypted file unless the 
repository is “locked”. You can do this manually:

[source,bash]
----
git-crypt lock
cat .env
# GITCRYPT��X�f�{gL�#�@K>���Ox��s܊��WhE�g
#                                           �i����
# �j��9�Q�2�|f�R�Z�Ğ��
# Ahh much better
----

Or, you can verify this by cloning the repository again and verifying that it’s locked by default

[source,bash]

----
# Unlock your current repository, so we can sanity check it still clones the encrypted version from a decrypted
# repo
git-crypt unlock
# Clone the current repo to a new dir. There's no special magic here.
git clone /tmp/foo /tmp/bar
# Cloning into '/tmp/bar'...
# done.
# Cat the file
cat .env
# GITCRYPT��X�f�{gL�#�@K>���Ox��s܊��WhE�g
#                                           �i����
# �j��9�Q�2�|f�R�Z�Ğ��
----

Perfect! It appears to be encrypted. Let’s clean up, and go back to our previous repo:

[source,bash]
----
cd /tmp/foo
rm -rf /tmp/bar
----

If you’re using one of the aforementioned packages, such as dotenv for either ruby or php, you can stop here. However, 
the vast majority of applications do not have support for environment configuration. So, we use `envsubst` to polyfill 
these applications by generating the “secret” configuration with a template file, and the `.env` file.

Let’s use Magentos `local.xml` as an example:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p etc/magento
cd etc/magento
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenMage/magento-mirror/magento-1.9/app/etc/local.xml.template
----

`cat` that file yourself, so you can see the contents. I’m not going to print them inline, as it’s long, and I don’t want 
to.

[source,bash]
----
cat local.xml.template
# It's a bunch of XML with placeholders that look like "{{value}}"
----

We’re deliberately not going to explore what all of these values mean, and which ones should be secret. Instead, we’re 
just going to pretend that the rest is all filled out, and that `{{db_pass}}` and `{{key}}` are secret. So, we need to 
generate a .env file similar to the one from earlier:

[source,bash]
----
# If you copy paste this, be careful not to copy the linebreak after the last EOF.
# See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2953081/how-can-i-write-a-here-doc-to-a-file-in-bash-script
cat << EOF > .env
KEY="329896ae9dc8eb488dfd5f9d7d25b08f"
DB_PASS="totallysecurepassword"
EOF
----

Next, we have to modify the `local.xml.template` file to be in the format that `envsubst` expects. Basically, it uses 
placeholders that look like `$VARIABLE_NAME`, like bash.

[source,bash]
----
# This replaces {{whatever}} with $WHATEVER
sed --in-place 's/{{key}}/$KEY/' local.xml.template
sed --in-place 's/{{db_pass}}/$DB_PASS/' local.xml.template
----

That’s it! Now, we can generate our `local.xml` file with the secret information:

[source,bash]
----
# Broadly, this does a few things:
#   cat local.xml.template        # Read the file from local.xml.template into stdout
#   eval $(cat .env | xargs)      # Read .env into stdout, and convert it into a sting of the form
#                                 #   'FOO="bar" BAZ="herp" envsubst'. eval then executes that as a bash command
cat local.xml.template | eval "$(cat .env | xargs) envsubst" > local.xml
----

That’s it! Our `local.xml` is generated, and filled with the appropriate information. To be safe, we should add that file 
to `.gitignore`:

[source,bash]
----
echo "local.xml" > .gitignore
----

Commit it

[source,bash]
----
git add local.xml.template .env .gitignore
git commit -F - <<EOF
Add local.xml.template, encrypted .env

This commit stores the local.xml used in the production environment,
but without the secret information, as local.xml.template. The secret
information is stored in a .env file and encrypted by git-crypt.

The encryption signal is handled by the .gitattributes file in the top
level of the repository.
EOF

# [master b1517a9] Add local.xml.template, encrypted .env
#  3 files changed, 67 insertions (+)
#  create mode 100644 etc/magento/.env
#  create mode 100644 etc/magento/.gitignore
#  create mode 100644 etc/magento/local.xml.template
----

That’s it! Protip: It’s a good idea to comment how to generate the template file in the template file, so your 
colleagues can understand what’s going on. Or, point them here. ;)

== Handling CI/CD

If you’re using CI/CD it’s quite often that you will need to be able some form of secret in order to build or deploy the
application. If you are doing so, my recommendation is that you generate a PGP key pair on the build server, and 
encrypt the resources with CIs private key. If you’re unsure how to do this, see

- https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key/

== Primitive ACLs

git-crypt can be used to encrypt secrets that should only be visible by certain users, such as robot accounts used by 
the build service. Check out the documentation here:
