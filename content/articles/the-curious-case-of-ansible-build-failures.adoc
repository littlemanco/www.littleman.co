== The curious case of sudden Ansible build failures

So, I arrived a little earlier to work today to get some work done. First step: Set up a machine for QA. Luckily, we’ve 
done lots of work to make this a trivial exercise, it’s a push button operation! Except:

Boom. Failure. Now, the change I’d made to deploy this testing machine was
beyond innocuous, and should definitely not result in the failure that I saw.

Several annoyed and confused minutes later, I discover this cherry:

[source,bash]
----
[WARNING] Ansible is in a world writable directory (/opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build), ignoring it as an source.
----

What. Suddenly configuration was being ignored?

Balls. Backing up a step, we keep our build container suuuuper up to date. It looks like Ansible released a new version
this morning. Buried in that was this lovely PR:

- https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/42142/files[stable-2.5: ignore ansible.cfg in world writable cwd (#42070) #42142]

No more configuration for world writable directories. Now, this makes quite some sense; what doesn’t make sense is why 
the directory would be world writable for BitBucket Pipelines?! But whatever. A quick and dirty:

[source,bash]
----
# Correct the permissions on the build environment directory.
# See https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/42142/files
chmod 700 /opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build
----

in the build script, and we’re in our way.

Back to the rest of Friday morning, then.
