Work is billed in a 15 minute period called an "increment". As the team works they will track their time in blocks of
15 minutes, rounded up to the next 15 minute block.

Increments are billed at:

- 25 USD

Everything associated with a project is billed. This includes:

- Emails
- Meetings
- Discussions
- Development
- Documentation

Or anything else associated with working on the project.

Prices are subject to change, but will be honoured for the agreed upon period. By default, work is scheduled in
monthly blocks.
